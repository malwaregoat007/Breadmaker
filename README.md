# Breadmaker
Breadmaker is a piece of software that allows you to make an ATM dispense money. 


I'm selling Breadmaker for 250$ only. Payment can be sent to Cashapp or Zelle. After payment is sent and received by me, I will release the software to you in a compressed folder to either your phone number or your email or if you'd like it sent somewhere different than please let me know. File will look smaller than actual size because it's compressed but in actuality it's only 240mb so not that big. This tool will only run on ATM machines running on Windows operating systems and they must be on a 32bit architecture!!!!  Luckily most ATMs do. You will require a few things though in addition to this piece of software, you will need a USB flash drive or USB external hard drive, an external keyboard and mouse, a drill to drill into mechanical lock on the top portion of the machine right near the screen to gain access to USB ports. You'll get 2 files, Breadmaker1.0.exe and instructions.txt. This tool is extremely user friendly to use, and you do not need to be real computer savvy.
